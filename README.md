# Hi! Thank you for your interest in this small project

## What I did?
### I consumed the gift Api: https://developers.giphy.com/ to generate a random most popular gifts. 

## If you want to use this repo please follow the instructions below:
* First at all, you have to create an account on developers.giphy.com
* Second, generate the api key and complete the url code. (the key looks like: F7NNx7J2Q6taRLVi9TmWBpEPJqMDSjJV)
* Once you have complete the url code, let's start to code. 
* With an async function call the fetch function and set de url.
* Get the json data (almost all apis are jsons files) with another async function.
* Make a simple random number function(you will need the return of a whole number)
* In the HTML I put a button because I wanted to click on and generate a random gift, you can make what you want.
* So, You need a event on the button, when the user click, you will have this random gift. 
* You need to call all DOM elements you want to work with (I worked with an div, h3, and figcaption)
* Then, you have to create a variable and asign the json.data on the random function.
* Lastly, you get the data of the api you want. For example, I insert on my html the title and images of the gift.
